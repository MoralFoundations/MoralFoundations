  <br>According to Haidt's methodology, when applied strictly in an American context: <br><br> <b>Left-Liberals / Social Democrats</b> tend to score very high in Care, Fairness, and Liberty relative to In-Group Loyalty, Purity, and Authority, which they tend to score lowly on. <br><br> <b>Conservatives</b> tend to weigh all foundations relatively similarly to one another, valuing each of them to a moderately high level. <br><br> <b>Fascists</b> tend to score very high in In-Group Loyalty, Purity, and Authority relative to Care, Fairness, and Liberty, which they tend to score lowly on. <br><br> <b>Libertarians</b> tend to score very high in Liberty relative to the other foundations which they value little to moderately, though it is not uncommon for them to also place high value on Fairness. <br><br> <b>Progressive Socialists</b> tend to score very high in Care and Fairness relative to everything else which they value lowly (Including Liberty, which separates them from Left-Liberals). <br><br> <b>Marxist-Leninists</b> tend to score very high in Fairness relative to the other foundations which they value little to moderately, though it is not uncommon for them to also place high value on In-Group Loyalty, Purity, and/or Authority.
