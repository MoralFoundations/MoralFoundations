        <p id = "firsttext" > Moral Foundations Theory, developed by psychologists Jonathan Haidt and Craig Joseph, suggests that there are innate and universal psychological foundations underlying human morality. According to the theory, people's moral judgments are based on six primary foundations: Care, Fairness, Liberty, In-Group Loyalty, Purity, and Authority. These foundations represent evolved mechanisms that have helped humans navigate social interactions throughout history. Individuals and cultures may prioritize these foundations differently, leading to variations in moral values and beliefs. In this test, you will be presented with a statement, and then will answer with your opinion on the statement from a range of <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly effecting your scores. Your final scores will be shown as a percentage for each foundation, along with an explanation of each foundation's broader meaning down below.</p>
        <p id = "firsttext" >There are 48 questions in the test. The average time of completion is 15 minutes.</p>
